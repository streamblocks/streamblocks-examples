// Description:
// Constants for IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) Baseband
// transmission. Based on the C code implementation written
// by Amanullah Ghazi. Described in SDR-WInnComm 2013 paper
// "Low-complexity SDR Implementation of IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee)
// Baseband Transceiver on Application Specific Processor" 
//
// Changelog:
// - initial version 01/10/2012
// - cleanup for release 08/10/2012
